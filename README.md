# 📊 Sales & Customer Performance Dashboard (Tableau)

This repository contains an end-to-end Tableau project where I designed two dashboards — **Sales Performance** and **Customer Analytics** — based on a real-world style user story.  
The goal of this project is to present key business insights through clear KPIs, YoY trends, customer behaviour analysis, and interactive visual storytelling.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The dashboard suite helps business users such as Sales Managers, Customer Teams, and Executives understand:

- Year-over-year performance  
- Monthly and weekly sales patterns  
- Product subcategory contribution  
- Customer value, order behaviour, and profitability  
- Top-performing customers and sales trends  
- Regional and product-driven performance differences  

The project is based on a user story outlining the requirements (included in this repo).
